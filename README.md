# Instagram React

Hi, my name is Adriano, an undergraduate in Software Engineering in Brazil that likes web development, and this is Instagram React, a recreation of Instagram's main page using... you guessed! React.

This project was firstly bootstrapped with [Create React App (CRA)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but since CRA is now deprecated, I rewrote this project using Vite!

This is my first project involving the use of React. Not the best one, but I'm pretty proud of it!

## Features

This project is merely visual, meaning you can click some components and icons here and there, but they do not alter the user experience. The purpose of this project was mainly learn and understand componentization using React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the one and most important one to view the project:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
